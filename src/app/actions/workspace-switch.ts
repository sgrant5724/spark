/**
 * Create a workspace and switch into it.

 * Until now there was NO way to make one from inside the app: workspaces only
 * ever appeared at signup (one per new user) or by being invited into someone
 * else's. Worse, `requireMembership` redirects a user with zero memberships to
 * `/onboarding/workspace`, and that route didn't exist — so anyone in that
 * state (a revoked last membership, say) hit a dead end they couldn't escape.
 * This action backs that route as well as the button in Settings.
 *
 * ⚠ PLATFORM OPERATOR ONLY. A workspace is a whole tenant — its own brand,
 * content, connected accounts and API keys — so letting any signed-in user mint
 * them would turn every account into a self-serve tenant factory. This check is
 * the real boundary; hiding the buttons is only cosmetic, and a hand-rolled
 * POST would sail straight past that.
 *
 * The creator becomes ADMIN of what they create, matching what signup does.
