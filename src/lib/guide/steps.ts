/**
 * Elsie — the in-app guide.
 *
 * Named for LSI Media: "L-S-I" said aloud is *el-ess-eye*. She walks a new
 * operator through setting the app up and then through actually using it.
 *
 * ── The two design decisions that matter ────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. Elsie is CONTEXTUAL, not a fixed slideshow. Setup steps are filtered
 *    against what the workspace has actually done, so nobody is walked through
 *    connecting an account they connected last week. A tour that tells you to
 *    do things you have already done trains you to close it — and then it can't
 *    help with the things you haven't.
 * 2. Tours are SHORT AND CHOSEN. One 20-step march through every module is the
 *    same mistake in a different shape. Steps belong to a `track`; the welcome
 *    card offers the tracks and you take the one you need. Setup always comes
 *    first because being shown the composer is noise if nothing can post.
 *
 * This file is pure data + selectors, deliberately: the sequencing is the part
 * worth testing, and it shouldn't need a browser to do it.
 *
 * ⚠ ANCHORS ARE `data-elsie` ATTRIBUTES, NEVER CSS SELECTORS. A positional
 * selector breaks silently when a toolbar is reordered and then points
 * confidently at the wrong thing. `LeftRailNav` emits `nav/<href>` for every
 * rail entry, so any nav target is anchorable with no extra markup.
 */

   * A model is actually selected for this workspace. Distinct from `hasLlmKey`

   * work to a provider you may not have paid for, and the router falls back to
   * mock on failure — so it looks configured and quietly writes placeholder
   * text. That exact trap cost real time here; it earns its own step.
