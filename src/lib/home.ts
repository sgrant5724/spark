/**
 * The Home page's data: one decision queue and one pipeline, across every
 * module.
 *
 * The problem this solves is navigational, not informational. The app is three
 * merged products (CreateUp's YouTube tooling, Spark's blog engine, the Social
 * engine) and its nav answers "where does X live" — but the question a person
 * opens the app with is "what needs me right now", and until this file nothing
 * answered it anywhere. The engine is autonomous; the human's job is decisions.
 * So Home leads with the decisions and draws the pipeline those decisions sit
 * inside, and everything else on the page is secondary.
 *
 * Rules inherited from `social/overview.ts`, because they're why that panel
 * works:
 *   - Only things a person can ACT ON go in the queue. Conditions nobody can
 *     fix train people to ignore the panel.
 *   - Every count is measured, never estimated. Where a number can't be known
 *     the caller renders a dash and the reason.
 *
 * ⚠ NOTHING HERE CALLS ZERNIO (or any external API). Home renders on every
 * visit; its data comes from our own tables. That's why the queue counts
 * drafted review replies (ours) but not unanswered reviews (a live Zernio
 * listing) — Engage owns the live view.
