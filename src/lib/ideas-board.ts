/**
 * The one Ideas board (One-Loop step 4, the owner's decision "merge the
 * boards"). Article ideas (BlogIdea, workspace-scoped, drafted by the
 * autopilot) and video ideas (Idea, channel-scoped, written by a person on
 * the script canvas) stay two tables — a script's foreign key, the intel
 * source-video link, the onboarding and growth jobs, the public API and the
 * delete registry all point at the video table, and the autopilot, scoring,
 * assistant, metrics and reports at the article one; re-pointing all of that
 * would put the live tenants' drafting at risk for nothing a person can see.
 * What a person sees is ONE board with ONE vocabulary, and that is this file.
