        a: "Most description boxes — company profile, channel niche, topics, the social composer and more — have a small **Draft with AI** button. It writes a draft from what your workspace already knows (your profile, channels, topics, and anything you've typed into the form), then **proposes** it: you choose *Use it*, *Discard* or *Try again*, and nothing touches your text until you accept.\n\nNext to every button there's also an **instructions box** — type what you want (\"mention the London office\", \"keep it under ten words\") and press Enter or the button; the AI follows your steer, and an instruction alone is enough for it to draft even a short answer.\n\nTwo honest behaviours worth knowing: it **refuses instead of inventing** when there's nothing to draft from — an empty field in an empty workspace gets a hint about what to add first, not confident filler (your own rough text always counts, so “improve what I wrote” always works). And if no working AI key resolves, the proposal is **labelled as placeholder text** rather than being passed off as real.\n\nA few fields deliberately have no button: expert answers and voice-training samples must be a real person's own words, or the profiles trained on them are poisoned.",

This is the checkpoint where a human reads it.\n**Approval** (`final_approval`) — reviewed and queued to go out, waiting on the final say.\n**Published** — live.\n\nThe split matters because automation is allowed to move a post *into* review, but only fully automatic mode may publish from approval — and even then the publish gates re-run first, so a post with unverified citations can never go out unattended.",

        a: "Because your workspace is on the **mock image provider** — no image key resolved, so every render returns a stock photo picked from your prompt instead of a real generation. It's worth knowing this looks like success rather than failure: you get a real, good-looking photo, just not one that has anything to do with your title. Thumbnail Studio shows a banner whenever the provider actually resolving is the mock.\n\n**Real image generation is built in** — paste an **OpenAI** or **Google** key under Admin → API keys and the *Image generation* switch picks it up (Auto prefers OpenAI's gpt-image-1 because it renders legible text more reliably, which thumbnails need). Renders are stored durably with your other files, and the studio's Clone analysis genuinely *looks at* the reference image.\n\nWith a real provider the `Require images to publish` gate under Blog → Brand does exactly what it says; on the mock it can gate a post behind an image that only ever will be stock — turn it off there if that blocks you.",

Anything with a small **?** next to it has a one-line explanation on hover — and some controls (the left-rail modules, the per-network *Customize* button, character counts) explain themselves when you hover the control directly.\n\nThey work on keyboard focus too, so tabbing through a form surfaces the same text.

The autopilot writes fresh posts from your active **Topics** (rotating through them), in your motif tone, one at a time spread across the day — each gets an auto-image and is queued into a free posting slot, or **held for approval** when the approval workflow is on.\n\nSafety rails: everything respects the global pause, counts against the daily AI budget (20 generations/workspace/day), and **placeholder output is never stored** — if no real AI key resolves, nothing is generated rather than something fake.

Two honest rules: your own attachment always wins over generation, and if the workspace has no real image provider the post simply stays text-only — the mock never fakes it with a stock photo.

A **0 means we counted and the answer really is zero**. For that reason counts are always exact, while rates and medians carry a **confidence** based on how many items produced them: “100% publish rate” from two posts is labelled low confidence rather than presented as a fact.

If every slot in the horizon is taken the app tells you rather than inventing a time, and pausing a slot never un-schedules a post already sitting in it.",

Queueing then routes each post to its own lane. The matching rule is designed so nothing ever strands: a categorized post falls back to a general (uncategorized) slot when its lane is full, and an uncategorized post takes a general slot first but will use any free slot if that's all there is. Workspaces that never touch categories behave exactly as before.",
